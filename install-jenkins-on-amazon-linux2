Amazon Corretto 11 has a 'headless' variant available. This variant omits runtime dependencies that are typically associated with GUI applications such as X11 and ALSA and is worth considering for server-oriented workloads.

Option 1: Install headless Amazon Corretto 11:

sudo yum install java-11-amazon-corretto-headless
Option 2: Install the full Amazon Corretto 11:

sudo yum install java-11-amazon-corretto
The installation location is /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-amazon-corretto.<cpu_arch>.
Verify Your Installation
To verify the installation, run java -version in a console. If the version string doesn't mention Corretto, run the following command to change the default java provider.

sudo alternatives --config java

Jenkins Redhat Packages

sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
  sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
  
If you've previously imported the key from Jenkins, the rpm --import will fail because you already have a key. Please ignore that and move on.


  yum install jenkins
